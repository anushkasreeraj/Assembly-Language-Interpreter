# Assembly-Language-Interpreter
This is my first mini project being a freshmen. This project, Mini Assembly Language Interpreter, was developed using Python and Tkinter with the goal of simplifying the understanding of 8085 microprocessor programming. When I first began learning assembly language, I found it quite challenging to grasp how individual instructions interacted with registers, memory, and flags. To overcome this, I decided to create my own interpreter that could visually demonstrate how each line of code executes. This hands-on approach helped me connect theoretical concepts with their actual behavior, making learning much more intuitive and interactive.
The interpreter supports a range of 8085 instructions such as MOV, MVI, ADD, SUB, and INR, and includes a PRN statement that allows users to display intermediate outputs during program execution. The GUI enables easy code editing, real-time register tracking, and memory inspection, providing an engaging environment for experimentation. Overall, this project not only strengthened my understanding of low-level programming but also enhanced my skills in Python, debugging, and GUI development.
